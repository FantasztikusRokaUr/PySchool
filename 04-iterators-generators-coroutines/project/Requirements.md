# Weekend Project "Iterators, Generators, Coroutijes" :cyclone:

## Technical Requirements
This weeks project shall wrap up the topic of iterators, generators and coroutines in Python. 
One of the following projects shall be reimplemented and potentially enhanced:
- [X] [Game Of Life](http://www.effectivepython.com/2015/03/10/consider-coroutines-to-run-many-functions-concurrently/)
- [ ] [Compiler Tree Builder](http://www.dabeaz.com/finalgenerator/FinalGenerator.pdf)
- [ ] [Chatroom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-UcUs7IMIM&feature=youtu.be) 

## Implementation
The [game of life](https://github.com/jgoerner/PySchool/blob/master/04-iterators-generators-coroutines/project/src/game_of_life.py) was taken from [here](http://www.effectivepython.com/2015/03/10/consider-coroutines-to-run-many-functions-concurrently/) 
and illustrates the usage of generators and coroutines.
A flow of the yields is depicted below:
